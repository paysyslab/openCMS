    OpenCMS is a product used for managing card systems. It is designed to be
    flexible, allowing clients to configure products according to their specific
    needs. Once the products are set up, clients can define the limits that
    apply to each product, as well as set fees for events and transactions based
    on the productâ€™s niche. Major payment schemes like Visa, Mastercard, and UPI
    can be used to create the cards.
